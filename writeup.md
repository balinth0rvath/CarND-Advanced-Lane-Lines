# Advanced Lane Finding Project

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

### 1 Camera calibration
*    Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.

### 2 Create Pipeline
*    Apply a distortion correction to raw images.
*    Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
*    Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").
*    Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
*    Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
*    Save frame data and create averages
*    Sanity check the results and correct frames if needed
*    Merge the detected lane boundaries, curvature and center offset back onto the original image.

### 3 Video Processing    
*    Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.
 
## [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/571/view) Points

### Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.  


### Camera Calibration

#### 1. Briefly state how you computed the camera matrix and distortion coefficients. Provide an example of a distortion corrected calibration image.


### Pipeline (single images)

#### 1. Provide an example of a distortion-corrected image.


#### 2. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you used color transforms, gradients or other methods to create a thresholded binary image.  Provide an example of a binary image result.


#### 3. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you performed a perspective transform and provide an example of a transformed image.


#### 4. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you identified lane-line pixels and fit their positions with a polynomial?


#### 5. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you calculated the radius of curvature of the lane and the position of the vehicle with respect to center.


#### 6. Provide an example image of your result plotted back down onto the road such that the lane area is identified clearly.


### Pipeline (video)

#### 1. Provide a link to your final video output.  Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video (wobbly lines are ok but no catastrophic failures that would cause the car to drive off the road!).

Here's a [link to my video result]

### Discussion

#### 1. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?

Here I'll talk about the approach I took, what techniques I used, what worked and why, where the pipeline might fail and how I might improve it if I were going to pursue this project further.
